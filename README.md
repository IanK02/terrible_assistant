# Terrible Assistant
## The Proposal
I wanted to make a little ai assistant to have in the kitchen. Not a traditional assistant however, not something that could give useful answers to reasonable
questions about cooking or baking, I wanted to make something with a bit more personality.

## The Useless Assistant
The assistant takes on the personality of a devout conspiracy theorist, answering any question with its foremost theory on the topic. It has a theory for every
question or topic imaginable, and cannot wait to share it.

## Implementation
The assistant was made with Google's Gemini AI API, as well as Google's Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text API. PyAudio and PyGame were used to handle the
audio functions of the assitant. The project runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W using the DietPi OS.
